## Overview of Project

In this module, you will use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.
## Analysis

Use a set of URLs to map earthquake data (USGS) and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and use different styles of maps to display the information.

Data:

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson 

The rest are on jsons in the repository
## Results

Retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data that is hosted on earthquake.usgs.gov. Using a Mapbox API, the Leaflet JS library through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
